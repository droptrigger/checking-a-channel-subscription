## ðŸ“– Description

To work, you will need access to the necessary channels and a bot.

Which groups you need to subscribe to can be written in the code, or you can get them from the database.

## ðŸ¤– Launching the bot

### 1. First, you will need to clone the repository to your computer via Git Bash.

```git
git clone https://github.com/droptrigger/checking-a-channel-subscription-telegram.git
```

### 2. We will install all the necessary libraries:

```pip
pip install aiogram
```

### 3. Go to https://t.me/BotFather and we create a bot. We allow you to invite him to the channels (It should be written `enabled`).

### 5. In [config](bot/data/config.py ) enter this token instead of a pass.

### 6. Add the bot to the channel, copy the link to this channel.
